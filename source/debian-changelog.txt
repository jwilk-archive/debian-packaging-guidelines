debian/changelog
================

New packages
------------
There should be exactly one changelog entry.

.. todo:: Provide rationale for the above.

Changelog should close ITP bug. Double-check if the bug number is correct.

Get rid of boilerplate like ``<423737 is the bug number of your ITP>`` or
``source package automatically created by stdeb``.

.. todo:: Does this happen often enough to be worth mentioning? I think I've
          seen this only 2 times so far.

There normally should be only one changelog item saying something like
``Initial release (closes: #423737)``. However, if you introduced patches in
the initial release, it's worth documenting them, too.

Do not document changes that you made to packaging e.g. between first upload to
mentors and the actual upload to the archive.

.. todo:: Provie rationale for the above.
