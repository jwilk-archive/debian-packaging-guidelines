============
``--buildsystem=python_distutils`` is not needed most of the time; ``dh`` is
able to figure out build system itself. Exception: if there is both
``Makefile`` and ``setup.py`` it top-level directory, ``dh`` will prefer the
former.

Get rid of boilerplate like ``This file was automatically generated by stdeb``
or ``This file was originally written by Joey Hess and Craig Small``.

Do not run ``dh_testroot`` in the clean target. There's a good chance that root
privileges are not needed (e.g. because binary target was run under fakeroot),
and even if they are actually needed, the target will fail quickly.
