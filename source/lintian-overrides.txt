Lintian overrides
=================
Every override should have a comment explaining why it was added.

Add override if the tag is false positive and it's not feasible to fix lintian.

As a temporary measure, you can also add override for false positives that you
expect to be fixed. In such cases, include lintian bug number in the comment.

You can add override if the tag is true positive, but for a good reason you are
not going to fix the problem. (“I am to lazy to do it” does not count as a good
reason.)
